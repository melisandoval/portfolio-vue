# My new portfolio website!

New year, new portfolio website ðŸ˜….

I felt like the design and the stack of my [first portfolio](https://melisandoval.github.io/personal-portfolio/) from last year didn't represent me anymore. I wanted to create a new one with an style (...a little bit) more minimalist and a JavaScript framework instead of plain HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.

Looking for design inspiration, I found [this template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1095695980466714349) and I really liked it, but instead of using it, I wanted to build something inspired by it from scratch with Vue.js. On the way, I ended up adding my personal touch to the design.

Here is the live version: https://melisandoval.vercel.app/ .
